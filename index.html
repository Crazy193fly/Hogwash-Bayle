Despite that, saving neither the children, the pregnant, the sick, nor the elderly, all of the villagers remained standing. Some looked around, while others quietly whispered; nevertheless they all waited.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite this, none of the villagers had the idea to be annoyed, rather, the silence, with each passing second, pierced each of their hearts with fear. If not for themselves, then they feared for others, the people they had lived with their entire lives in this prison of a village. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking around, it&rsquo;d be easy to conclude that the village was located in some cave or somewhere far underground. The village was surrounded by a greyish rock that stacked upon one another to create an uneven wall that separated the contents of the village from the outside. With nary a single crack within the walls, there was no way for any type of sunlight to enter, or for any type of sound to leave. Every whisper, every creak of the wooden houses echoed across every surface. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although, even without any form of sunlight, the people could still see that the cave provided its light in the form of a multitude of gems that attached themselves to all surfaces of the cave. Rather than being additions to the cave, they looked to have been attached to the walls of the cave purposely to provide light to the villagers. However, even with that benevolence in mind, these gems hardly acted as true replacements for the sun&rsquo;s rays; none of these gems provided any type of nourishment or energy; rather, they all emitted the same greyish light that permeated every surface of the village. Ultimately, this rendered the people of the village pale as a sheet of paper, and just as thin.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air remained neither cold nor hot. No wind or anything suggesting this place was made for life. The area in which they lived had no natural water sources or life to consume; the ground was much too rough to grow anything if they were even permitted to have seeds in the first place, and beyond that, the only animals around were other humans they shared their captivity with. This being the case for almost all of the village, except for a sole tree planted square in the middle of the crowd towards the middle of the village. However, just like the people, the tree had no motivation to grow any farther than it had, almost like it had been trapped in time; its leaves grey and its trunk a heavily watered-down brown.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, these villagers had no time to dwell on the circumstances they&rsquo;ve been dealt and the life they&rsquo;ve lived, especially with nothing to compare their lives to. To them, the only one they could blame was the same god they prayed to save them. But that was too cruel to imagine. So prayer was one of many small hopes that helped each of them live their lives in this well of despair. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &quot;You&#39;re soooo insanely pathetic.&quot; </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One muttered under their breath, while staring at the tree that pathetically stretched to his neck. Whether or not he was referring to the people or the tree was irrelevant, as no one noticed he had spoken. Even in the middle of this crowd, no one wanted, or more like dared to even stand within arm&#39;s reach of the man. Subconsciously or not, no one wanted to even consider him when they prayed for their lives, like the mere thought of him would shrivel up any chance they had to reconcile or plead with God. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through their endless prayers, interrupted by the clattering of their teeth and the shaking of their bodies, they all kept their eyes peeled towards the one door that marked both the exit, but more importantly in this case, the entrance into their village. Unlike the rest of the decrepit village, full of one-room houses, some missing walls, others * entirely, this sole door shone in a coat of polish that burned into the villagers&#39; eyes. Just like what was beyond it, the door itself was completely foreign to the rest of the village, like it was from another world. It was made from a high-quality wood, painted over with a never-blemishing coat of wax which in turn covered its golden handle. That one piece of gold was enough to give a sense of fear. Fear not in the sense of why it was there, unlike what was beyond it, but a fear of what would happen if one of them touched it. None of them had any association of gold beyond that handle, so to them it was the farthest thing from being valuable in a monetary sense.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In all of the lives of the villagers, no one had ever touched that door, much less had the determination to do so. Even if it may have flashed across the minds of many, if not all of them, what &lsquo;could&rsquo; happen and what &lsquo;would&rsquo; happen was far too hard to imagine. Although, the thought of punishment was almost assured. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They stared towards the door, some looking away briefly, some closing their eyes in anticipation, but none of them had the confidence to truly look away for long or remove the door from their minds, even for a second. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, finally, the subject of their fear had arrived. The devil they prayed to be saved from. The worst of &lsquo;humanity&rsquo; they could imagine. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door slowly crept open, revealing one hand gloved in a comically large white glove, followed by an arm, then a torso, then the face, and finally the full body. Now completely exposed, the villagers could see their &lsquo;devil&rsquo; in all of its glory. It wore checkered green overalls on top of a bright purple shirt, big brown boots, and alongside its large gloves, it donned a large bunny mask that covered all discernible details of its face. Rather than a &lsquo;devil&rsquo; or even a &lsquo;person&rsquo; it looked more like a cartoon you&rsquo;d have watched as a child, which was a memory the villagers lacked, but even so, to all of the villagers it still looked like an eerie imitation of a lighthearted appearance, even down to the very mask it hides its face with. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of many pieces &ldquo;off&rdquo; with its presentation was the mask it adorned. Although flush with big pink cheeks and a mouth side to side into a big toothy smile, its eyes were irregular. They were completely off. They were completely devoid of all emotion, light, or texture, like they were glimpses into the abyss itself. Even with the pleasant coating that permeated his design, there was no masking the evil that traced his very presence. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now fully out of the door, he looked around from one side of the village to another, like he was scanning for irregularities, then nodded to show he was pleased. Afterwards, he finally began towards the platform, walking in uniform steps with his arms crossed behind his back like an instructor. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With it finally on its way, two others followed, both wearing matching crow masks too big for their statures. Unlike the first, these two did not try in the slightest to hide their vile nature, both displaying hatchets on the waists of their matching black garbs, which unnervingly covered their entire bodies from head to toe. This left no way for anyone to interpret them in any way to be human, allowing one&#39;s mind to easily come to the conclusion that they were both nothing other than demons that had taken the rough shape of humans. Compared to the Bunny, these two were especially evil.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As one entered, it stopped while staring forwards as well, except in this case not because they were observing the sight, but because it was seemingly mindlessly waiting for the other which had stopped to close the door behind it. This revealed the only thing not hidden in its garb: one surgical glove tightly wrapped around its wrinkled hands. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once the door was closed and the village was once again properly closed off, they both started towards the platform as well, walking in an off-putting unison; where one would step, the other would follow in suit, both walking adjacent to each other and in complete symmetry. Because of their equilibrium, however, it was easy to see how odd their choice of mask truly was. Neither of them could carry their heads up correctly, so both of them held their heads low, which noticeably bent their backs forwards, but not enough to understate their lengthy statures, allowing them to stand taller than even the biggest in the village. This was because of the sheer length of their beaks, which extended from their faces all the way down to their waists.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the group of them made their way towards the platform, it let out one singular yet large moan, like it too was afraid of the pair of beasts that were at most a minute away from arriving. However, magically so, the platform released no more noises once the Bunny Man finally stepped on, like it was too afraid to even exist. It hushed completely and stood still underneath the giants that had stepped foot onto it. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Giant&rdquo; would be a fitting description for the Bunny man who had now presented himself in all of his glory. Now that he was standing in front of the crowd, and next to both of the crow masks, his size could finally be comprehended in its greatness. He stood far taller than the crows and even taller than the platform itself, even if slightly so, he towered over everyone and everything, including the dilapidated buildings that were scattered across the village. Even if the buildings themselves were only one story, one room at best, they were still all the people had to go by, so to them, he was undoubtedly something inhuman, even more so when compared to their malnourished bodies. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Well then. As always, I must extend my gratitude to this village&#39;s great Chief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He begins while opening his arms out to gesture to all of the crowd, then going on to gesture directly towards the village chief who stood almost completely invisible in the thicket of people. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon those words, spoken in an oddly normal tone and voice, the chief began to crumple. With just one sentence, the Bunny Man had completely frozen the elder in place. Eyes wide and mouth open, he remained standing like a statue.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then, out of the crowd of people, ever afraid and reluctant to even move, there was one small noise. What sounded like a chuckle echoed all around the almost completely silent village. Upon hearing so, even the Bunny Man froze; however, the reason was just as hard to understand as the rest of his character. Even so, that reaction was enough to draw the eyes of the crowd away from the Bunny Man and towards the source. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With each second that passed, the fears of the people increased exponentially. If it wasn&rsquo;t fear of the Bunny Man&rsquo;s reaction, then it was fear of the unknown noise and fear of what it meant. Even if it had sounded like a chuckle to some, the environment itself made it easy to fall into fear.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of everyone had now started to reluctantly look around for the source of the noise, until they each followed each other&#39;s eyes upon the ultimate source of their plight. What they saw was the drag of their small society, the one person no one wanted to think about unless forced to: they finally laid their eyes upon the one standing isolated before the village&#39;s only tree. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Staring back, he held his face high while standing there in full confidence of both himself and his surroundings. He knew the exact situation he had brought upon himself. He knew that everyone&#39;s eyes were on him, even the Bunny Man&rsquo;s himself; however, he remained steadfast, completely unnerved and unflinching with his smile. His face had been stretched tightly into a toothed smile, one that wrinkled his face, one that screamed &ldquo;no good,&rdquo; and finally, after what felt like an eternity, he simply raised his right hand into a greeting, before closing his eyes in self-assurance, then finally speaking.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Oh no-no-no, sorry about interrupting your speech. I just couldn&rsquo;t hold it in! After all, with you dressed like that and a crowd like this! How could I not find this a little funny? I&rsquo;d even say it&rsquo;d be irresponsible to say it was all my fault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The village once again returned to silence; however, this time a complete silence that engulfed even their breaths and the beating of the villagers&rsquo; hearts. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Almost like he was waiting for the rest of the people to fully process the response they had been delivered, or even as he was contemplating his answer himself, the Bunny Man finally spoke.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Of course. I fully understand what you&#39;re saying. This is quite the spectacle now that I reflect on it; however, now that this has happened once, please try to keep the interruptions to a minimum. I will not impede upon you being true to yourself, but please try keeping outbursts like this till after I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man looked around through the crowd and to each of the villagers, before finally settling on the source of the interruption. Upon seeing no one refute him, he looked back at the crowd as a whole before continuing his speech.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Now then. Since I have already expressed my gratitude towards the village chief, I must now thank everyone else who makes this understandably troubling process so much easier than it could have been otherwise. Every couple of months to year, you all wait for me like one large, tight-knit community. The thought of it truly sends my heart ablaze and makes keeping this village around that much more rewarding. Seeing all of your precious eyes every month is quite the highlight with all of my important work-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He continued rambling on and on until he was finally interrupted by both of the crows, who in unison tapped on both of his arms, finally alerting him to the irrelevant nature of his incoherent speech. After a little pause and bringing his hand to his mouth to gesture a clearing of his throat, he once again began his speech anew, trying to steer back to why he was there in the first place.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;My apologies. I was talking too much. I&rsquo;d rather not bore you all before getting to the main point of my speech. Anyways, to sum everything up, I see you all as a part of my own family.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though his words resembled him professing his love for the villagers, each word felt like the cold embrace of a corpse strangling the hearts of each listener. It wouldn&rsquo;t be much of an exaggeration to say that their hearts were being crushed with every sentence. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the speech continued on and on, it felt as if the whole world itself was starting to get colder, as every familial connection was replaced with thoughts about the Bunny Man. Breathing was stifled, and hearts were paused. Now, once again, the attention of the crowd was unmistakably on the Bunny Man, as every villager felt their innards being plunged into cold waters with every profession. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;With that, it makes it just as hard on me as it does anyone else when I say that I&rsquo;m here to procure another volunteer.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He spoke while looking down and sighing in a drawn-out and dramatic fashion, making sure to keep his voice at a loud enough level so that anyone in the crowd could hear, like the sigh itself was a part of the roughly premeditated speech. Or so that was the conclusion many had reached before they had been forcefully grabbed by the Bunny Man&rsquo;s twisted words.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The word volunteer itself struck a painful blade into the minds of everyone who had still retained their reasoning in the face of the Bunny man&rsquo;s constant barrages. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;As you all know, in return for our god&#39;s love, they require yet another volunteer to properly sustain the resources I bring you all. After all its only reasonable to assume that their love is to be reciprocated by another&rsquo;s&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man in front of the grey tree once again broke into another wrinkled smile, like he was waiting for what was to come next. On the other hand, this was now when the biggest fear of all the villagers finally came to be; the moment they had all been dreading; the source of their ever-rising fear and uncertainty. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Now, do we have any brave volunteers? There&#39;s no need to be shy; if you volunteer, this will be the APEX, the GREATEST moment of your lives guaranteed. This is the moment you get to decide how you will be remembered, either as a brave martyr ready to be brought in front of our god, or one of many who were too scared to take their fate into their own hands. Furthermore, even if you cannot predict the rest of your lives and if you fear what&#39;s to come, one thing I can guarantee without a shadow of doubt is that your valiant sacrifice will feed your friends and family for a lifetime and sustain this great village for even longer. You have all seen this undoubtedly, when my apprentices bring the food you all gorge on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, his reasoning falls on deaf ears. No one raises their hands, not even the bravest of them, who would rather stall for as long as they possibly could. No one wanted to be the sole volunteer, even if it seemed impossibly slim, each villager waiting on bated breath for another to take charge. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After what seemed like an eternity of desperate prayers and subconscious hope in each other&#39;s benevolence, no one had raised their hands or said anything to suggest they were going to. Waiting and waiting was all anyone could do outside of damning themselves, so they continued to wait. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;I understand. It&#39;s asking too much of all of you to simply trust my words. However, I will not let your selfishness prevent this village&#39;s prosperous future. I will not let your fears stop you from bearing our god&rsquo;s blessings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He began in a more assertive tone, one he seemed to have been hiding since the start, and one that still didn&#39;t seem quite right. He still seemed to be keeping up his passionate way of speech, even when his eyes showed complete indifference, or that was what could be perceived from his abyss-like eyes. Even so, that was enough to push the crowd back, like they were subconsciously preparing to run even though their minds knew there was nowhere to run to.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny man: &ldquo;Now then, I will begin to list off my ideal volunteer: young, preferably below the age of 10, brave, shining, proud of oneself, able to hold oneself up in adversity-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man began to list, making a point to emphasize every point like God themselves were requesting. This ideal was someone pure, someone far from the people before him. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once complete in his list, the Bunny Man looked face to face, but rather than looking at their physical stature, it seemed like he was looking into each of their very souls to determine whether or not they were a good fit. Ultimately; however, upon reaching the very ends of the crowd, he shook his head to indicate that he had not seen a single person who matched his idea of someone perfect for the role. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;When was the last time I was here in this very village? I must say it had to have been a sizable length of time for there to be no one even remotely close to what our gods&#39; criteria list. No children to be seen and no one great enough to make up for it. This is very bad indeed. This is incredibly dire. What will we do now? Who would be worthy, let alone able to gain our god&#39;s favor?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bunny man contemplated whilst raising one of his hands to his chin, keeping the other behind his back. To the silent reaction of the crowd, the Bunny man once again shook his head, then began once more. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny man: &ldquo;If no one will volunteer or match the criteria for involuntary volunteering, then I just have no choice other than to appoint our next volunteer myself. If there is no way past, then I will have to clear the way myself. I will decide who gets to hold our god&rsquo;s favor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny man then extended his previously raised hand and pointed forwards into the crowd; however, even though he was pointing directly into the crowd to whom he was pointing to was blatantly obvious. The one he pointed to was the very same one who had asserted his presence into the crowds and Bunny Man&rsquo;s consciousness earlier in the speech. No one other than the one standing before the grey tree. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somehow, the man&#39;s already stretched face began to widen even more, as he smiled like he had been presented with a gift he had been anticipating for ages; then he threw both of his hands out into the air before dramatically shouting. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Me?! What a horror! There&#39;s no mistaking it! If I leave, I will most certainly die! God&rsquo;s love? How could a god command someone to kill? Will no one volunteer in my stead? Will no one reveal themselves as a hero? Will no one come to my rescue?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To that desperate proclamation, the crowd remained in a now stunned silence, no one able to or wanting to speak out in the man&#39;s defence. No one came to the rescue of the man they long wanted to forget, the man who committed some type of unforgivable sin that isolated him from the rest of the village. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;You are all so completely, utterly, undoubtedly pathetic. Not one of you has ever stopped me before, so now you&#39;re just letting our village&#39;s devil pick me off himself. Boring is all I can say. This entire village bores me to death. I do what I want whenever I want with no one to challenge me. You all wallow in your sins and just sit here rotting away until you eventually die some pathetically boring death, I can hardly stand it. If I did remain here, I&rsquo;d probably just kill myself anyway. No, I&#39;d kill you all beforehand. That&rsquo;d be a mercy if all you did was wait for death anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was not even looking towards the crowd at this point; no one around him piqued even the slightest bit of his interest. To him, they all felt like mannequins that looked vaguely similar to people. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you agree, Bunny Man? A life of such isolation is just simply torturous for someone like me. Would your god really damn me to this hell?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He spoke while directly addressing the Bunny Man, who had been waiting patiently for the whole monologue to play out before speaking. Furthermore, once the monologue was understandably over with, the Bunny Man buried his mask into his hands, like he was solemnly contemplating his answer. It was like the Bunny Man was solemnly taking in what the Man had said in all.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;It saddens me deeply that you have been saddled with such a fate. I understand it well! The purity of one&#39;s desires cannot truly be brought out if there is not an equivalent, if not a greater, opposing force to push back. After all, with no opposition, the only result is stagnation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">The Bunny Man passionately expelled his worries onto the crowd, who had now mostly </span><span class="c10">forgone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their attempts to understand the meaning behind what the two of them had been talking about. Furthermore; once finished with his passionate demonstration, he dramatically raised his hands outwards..</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;However, I promise you here and now that I will test the extent of your purest desires, I will be the opposing force that raises you to a state of clarity! And to do so, you will be this village&#39;s next volunteer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the man before the grey tree was onboard all uptill now, he finally lowered his smile even if so slightly while also lowering his eyebrows, like the Bunny Man had overfilled the glass that was the Man.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;That&#39;s alright, I guess. I&rsquo;m not too sure about what you&#39;re talking about. I just want to have fun, I&rsquo;m not sure about the &lsquo;purity of my desires&rsquo; or anything. Regardless, I&rsquo;ll be your volunteer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;I do not expect you to understand my words now, especially in a place like this. Not everyone can be as pure as they should be. However, with an attitude like yours, you are perfect for the role I require. If you cannot be truly pure, your attitude isn&rsquo;t far behind what I need. And so, that marks the end of our little family get-together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man abruptly proclaimed, before bowing with one arm to his back and the other one being waved into the pose of a bow. Upon finishing his goodbye, he raised himself and continued. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;You may all resume any activities interrupted by my visitation, and though I apologize for how lengthy this has been, I must end this on a rather sour note. Today, all things considered, I was quite lucky; if there hadn&#39;t been such an eager volunteer, I might have been forced into more drastic options. This leaves me with only one option: I will be leaving my two assistants behind me to encourage and strengthen cooperation between the people of this village. Next time I may visit in one month, or the month after that, or even in a year&#39;s time, I will be looking for new faces that fit within my requirements. And with that friendly reminder, my volunteer, please follow me to the exit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the Bunny Man gestured to the exit, the man immediately began walking, without saying any goodbyes or even looking at anyone else. The Man confidently strolled towards the village&#39;s one and only exit and upon seeing so, all those around him subconsciously began to follow him with their eyes. Up until now, they had never seen anyone so eager to throw away their lives, especially for a reason as idiotic as his. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the fun of it? Who had ever heard of such a reason to head into what&#39;s almost certainly death? To leave their only sanctuary? Not only that, but he does so without breaking a single sweat; there was nothing to indicate any form of anxiousness. Such reasoning, although completely idiotic, still left an impression on the villagers. The man they hated, without hesitation, reached for the door they all had longed for at some point in their lives. Even if they hide it, pretend they&rsquo;ve moved on from wanting to leave their small little village, none could look past the innate fear that walled the door off. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So while finally being forced to recognize the Man, a handful, if not more, of the villagers finally realized something. Not that they had been fools, not that they hated rather than feared the Bunny Man, but instead that they hated the Man. What seemed like surface-level hatred still left sharp scars in their bodies. A feeling not too dissimilar to the Bunny Man&#39;s words. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was fear truly what had clawed at their hearts? Or was it more? Nevertheless, they still could do nothing but watch. Or that would be the case if not for the one who had lived the longest in their prison, the one who had witnessed the most death, the one who cowered at even the simplest words from the Bunny Man. The village chief finally raised his head high and shouted. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chief: &ldquo;Young Man! Go on! Go on and live! Live where we couldn&rsquo;t! Experience life how we can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The village chief shouted with all of the strength his matured body could muster, with tears flowing from his eyes, he shouted and shouted over and over, taking desperate breaths in between each. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chief: &ldquo;This is what life is! Not cowering! Not simply getting by! Being alive is not living. Especially this, this could not be the farthest thing from it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old chief could not keep his eyes open any longer and could not possibly choke out anymore from his neglected voice. However, the idea still came out nonetheless. The entire crowd glared at the Man&rsquo;s complexion. Although not all of them understood the old man, they still watched on; rather, they could not possibly stop. Then one, then two, then two handfuls if not less began to yell as well. People from around the crowd. Although some wanted to join, their voices simply refused to move for their preservation, like their bodies clung to the idea of fear, even when faced with an easy way to express their hopes.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who had overcome their bodies continued to shout; they encouraged the Man, but by the time the Man had finally reached the door, they had finished all the courage they had remaining. It was like they had given the Man their dreams, while knowing they were unable to do the same as him.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unbothered by the passion the village had unleashed, the Man turned around with the same relaxed smile and simply spoke.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Hey Bunny Man! Are you gonna make a move on or just stand there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The village that had temporarily forgotten how close they had been to their supposed captor, sharply turned back towards him. They waited on bated breath for the Bunny Man&rsquo;s reaction; however, he simply looked on, stationary like a statue. The villagers could not tell whether or not he was angry, or even furious, so they waited. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the wait this time did not feel nearly as cold, like the villagers&#39; breath finally released the heat they had been suppressing, and while still afraid, they looked on firm. Even if they couldn&rsquo;t speak, their eyes still regained some type of light.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man continued to look on with a confused body expression, before silently turning around, and leaving the podium after lightly tapping the Crows on the shoulders in some type of familial expression. He then walked briskly towards the door, followed by the eyes of the ever-watchful villagers. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Man, upon finally getting close contact with the Bunny Man, examined his attire from top to bottom, then, after letting out a faint chuckle, finally opened the door and let himself out. The moment he did so, his body met with an air completely different than any he had felt prior. He stood there for a couple more seconds while his body processed his environment. He looked around briefly, seeing stone completely different from the village&rsquo;s walls; the walls of this exit were covered in discolored, bluish rock. However, before he could fully look around, the Bunny Man interrupted.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Like you said: now that everything is said and done, there is no reason to dally. You can look around while we walk to our only destination.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Those words snapped the Man back into reality, &lsquo;only destination.&rsquo; The </span><span class="c10">Man</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;looked around once more past the line of the door, seeing two long and poorly lit hallways to his left and forward, then looking to his right, he saw another door that looked almost the same as the one they had just left, that is, except for the handle, which was now silver. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean? Only destination, you&#39;re talking like I&rsquo;m going to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man, after closing the door, once again stood still, like he had heard something surprising. After looking towards the doorknob once more, he turned around, then sharply looked directly at the Man.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Mmmmmm? I thought you knew you were going to die. After all that you said, you can&rsquo;t be saying that you didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tone of his questions was oddly serious compared to his usually light-hearted tone of speech. For one reason or another, he stood completely still while tilting his head down for an answer, with the hallway&#39;s light falling short and shadow covering his mask. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Me?! Die! You can&rsquo;t be serious! Like hell I&rsquo;d die after all this. Sure, I knew you&rsquo;d probably try to kill me, but what of it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man stood still one last time, like he was contemplating the Man&rsquo;s answer. Relaxing his body while raising his head into the light, he let out a light-hearted sigh before starting to walk forward. Instead of going through the door to their right, the Bunny Man began to walk straight ahead.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;So what you&#39;re saying is that you can&rsquo;t imagine that I could kill you? That&rsquo;s quite presumptuous. Do you have such little faith in my abilities? I feel a little disheartened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Man, after hearing the Bunny Man&rsquo;s response, let out a light chuckle, as if what the Bunny Man had said was something humorous instead of a twisted declaration of his premeditated murder.. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Of course you can&#39;t! There&#39;s no shame in it. I&rsquo;m someone you cannot kill, no matter how hard you try. Because, after all, it&#39;s more interesting that way. Dying here after that spectacle would be pretty underwhelming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Underwhelming? I can understand to some degree. After the heartfelt words of your fellow villagers, you could not possibly die now. No. Dying now would be a disservice to their faith.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Man lowered his smile, then furrowed his eyebrows while suddenly turning his head towards the Bunny Man like he was surprised by something so crazy. The prospect of such a thing deeply troubled the Man, whose anger was noticeable.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;What does staying alive have to do with them? Those Ingrates? Heartfelt words? All they did was throw their dreams at me because they lacked the backbone to leave themselves. People like them make me sick. They&rsquo;re nothing more than pigs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man quickly interjected before the Man could continue rambling about his unfavorable thoughts towards the villagers who had wished him off. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny man: &ldquo;You say that like you believe you&#39;re different? Though I don&rsquo;t know your age, I&rsquo;m positive that you&rsquo;ve had previous chances to leave; however, instead of making a spectacle like today, you hid like the rest of the villagers. You ramble on and on about how you hate the villagers, but are you sure they are who you hate, Kukui?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Man, looking bored with the conversation, looked back forward, and while doing so, his eyes wandered to the rest of the foreign scenery. His eyes wandered to the oddly shaped white structures that emitted light from within themselves on the walls. To him, these white structures looked somewhat like the structures of his face, but without any of the fat overtop. Unbeknownst to him, however, those white structures were skulls that had candles lit within them, with their mouths acting as an opening to release the light, albeit poorly at that. While tilted upwards, the vicinity they lit up was still poorly designed, like the idea of skull lanterns was enough by itself. However, such a sight was just a momentary curiosity for the Man.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Sure, whatever you say, man, but I have my reasons. Besides, what&#39;s a Kukui?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny man did not pause delivering his response to the short retort the Man had thrown together. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;It took me a while to figure out who you were, after all, you don&rsquo;t fit any character profile I&rsquo;ve seen in that village. But upon referencing your features, I remember one young boy named Kukui. Although somewhat fitting, it&#39;s still an odd name in a place like this. After all, the tree you seemed to take interest in is a Kukui tree, even if it doesn&rsquo;t look like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;What? How the hell would anyone in the village know that? Besides, my name&rsquo;s not that, it&#39;s Bayle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle responded exasperatedly, while tracing the walls once they finally broke their straight line and turned the corner to another hallway that looked just as boring.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;Anyways, I think the origins of my name are the least interesting part of this situation, or at least for me. You&rsquo;ve probably killed countless kids the same way, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Of course I have. Though putting it that way makes me seem more evil than I am, as an apostle, I do what is expected from me under our god.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man&rsquo;s eagerness to answer and the oddly upbeat way he responded with such a twisted justification of child murder stunned Bayle for a minute. However, an answer like that wasn&rsquo;t too dissimilar to what he expected by now. From the way he was dressed and carried himself, a straight answer was out of the question. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean, you dress up all crazy, saying all of this flowery nonsense to cover up your twisted actions. You look more insane than if you&rsquo;d just worn something normal. Besides, all this religious talk makes you feel like some type of zealot; although, I suppose that fits now that I say it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle took another look at the Bunny Man&rsquo;s clothes before shaking his head in disapproval, while completely disregarding what the Bunny Man had said, like none of it had anything to do with him. Even now, he truly did not believe he was under any threat; however, whether or not that was the case was yet to be seen, and the Bunny Man&rsquo;s eagerness to flaunt that fact did not help Bayle&rsquo;s case. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man let out a short laugh; however, even that felt forced. At this point, it seemed that he had lost interest in the subject, or that he&rsquo;d gotten enough out of Bayle to be satisfied. He stood straight and rigid, like he had stopped trying to deceive Bayle with this poor acting. Ultimately, Bayle hadn&rsquo;t even noticed the change as he continued to walk side by side, if not a little ahead of the Bunny Man, like he was the one leading. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the next while, both just walked down the straight hallway, with the Bunny Man strolling in one relaxed pace, and Bayle in an irregularly impatient pace. While Bayle was looking around at the walls once more and drooping his body forwards like it&rsquo;d help quicken the pace, the Bunny Man walked with uniformly short strides, like he was trying to delay their arrival. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;What the hell, man? Why am I the only one trying to leave this damn hallway? Quicken the pace, your legs are bigger than half my body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle scorned once realizing the oddity of the Bunny Man&rsquo;s attitude; after all, Bayle was the one to be supposedly killed, while the Bunny Man was the one actively preventing their arrival. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Why would I want to quicken this journey? This experience has been quite the surprise. I&rsquo;ve personally seen many on this path, and no one has reacted the way you have. Most, if not all of them, beg for mercy, ask where they&#39;re going, or silently contemplate their lives while praying. I just wanted to see which you&rsquo;d do, and I suppose criticizing my walking speed fits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny man responded while adjusting his mask and keeping at his slow pace, before continuing his explanation onto something more ominous. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;Beyond that, I&rsquo;m also contemplating whether or not you&rsquo;ll die. All this talk has given me a little hope that you will, but since that&rsquo;s not my decision to make, I can only guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;Ha. I don&rsquo;t care who you think decides whether or not I&rsquo;ll die, but even if I miraculously let myself die, I&rsquo;d just venture to whatever god thought it&#39;d be a good idea to send some miscreant to kill me, and just kill them myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle nodded to acknowledge the Bunny Man&rsquo;s statements before smiling once more and speaking with his familiar optimism. However, at this point, optimism would be in itself an optimistic wording of Bayle&rsquo;s absolute belief in his ability to survive. Narcissism was a more fitting term.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The journey continued at the same pace. From time to time, they took a turn to the left, then, after another lengthy hallway, they took another turn in the same direction. At this point, both remained mostly silent, each one focused on their thoughts, or rather, that was Bayle&rsquo;s reason. He contemplated all possible situations, any way the Bunny Man could attempt to kill him, and in each situation, he came up with increasingly crazy solutions. For example, in case he&rsquo;d be stabbed, he thought up a scenario in which he would let the knife pierce straight through his hand, before delivering a punch directly to the opposition&#39;s head, so hard that he would have the opportunity to take the knife. Such examples were common in his head while his body mindlessly continued to walk. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this point, he had started to tune out his surroundings, disregarding everything around him, including the Bunny Man to some degree. Now would be an opportune moment to strike, but the Bunny Man walked forward the same as ever, like he never even considered the idea, or that such an idea was too preposterous to act upon. Even for someone with such an outwardly ominous presence, up till now, he acted rather passively. However, just like his appearance, the thought arises: was his lack of action also a part of his elaborate, yet poorly executed act? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite that, the thought completely missed Bayle, who continued to make up scenarios in which he was guaranteed to win. So they continued to walk onwards, this time making another left alongside the past two lefts. What was odd, however, was how the surroundings never changed to any degree, like they were made to be as identical as possible, even down to how certain rocks jut out around the skull lanterns. Among other things, this was also lost upon Bayle, who seemingly got too bored to care, that is, if he even noticed it to begin with. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;How much longer is it, damn it. We&rsquo;ve been walking for at least half an hour. Couldn&rsquo;t you have just put the destination closer? What&rsquo;s the point of this long as a hell hallway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle interjected among their loudly reverberating footsteps, cutting away at the tension he couldn&rsquo;t care to acknowledge. To this fact, the Bunny Man lowered his pace even further before sighing once more; however, in a more realistic way, like he&rsquo;d been unsatisfied with the situation.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Bunny Man: &ldquo;I suppose there is no point in trying to provoke a reaction out of you. You&#39;re something. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are or who you&#39;re with, you just continue with your bravado. In some respects, that could be a good quality; however, right now, I get the feeling you&#39;re just optimistically ignoring the situation. Why </span><span class="c10">that is</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">isn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;important anymore, since we&rsquo;re finally here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He pointed outwards at the end of the hallway, which remained too far away to be seen by someone with normal eyesight. Even with Bayle squinting, he could not see the end.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon finally making his point, he began to quicken his pace, signaling that he was finally finished with their long journey and that it was finally time to finish the business they had set out for. Bayle, upon seeing this, could not help but begin to smile once more.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;You can say what you want and do whatever you want; regardless, none of it changes the fact that I&rsquo;ll survive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle responded with that short yet all-encompassing statement, like the thought of death made him laugh, like the prospect was inconsiderable. Rather than dreading the end of the journey, he anticipated it with joy. It was like he was actively urging his fate to finally conclude. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that note, they began to quicken their pace more and more, into somewhat of a speed walk. Although Bayle was actively speed walking, the Bunny Man just had to extend his legs a little more to make up for the difference. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This remained the case until they had finally reached a point where Bayle could see the end. However, upon seeing him, his smile quickly fell into a look of irritation and anger.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious! After all of this, the way out was the door we passed at the beginning! You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me! You keep on talking about all of this talk about &lsquo;seeing how I respond,&rsquo; so you just wasted my damn time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle became so overwhelmed by his irritation that his eye began to twitch slightly, but at this overblown reaction, the Bunny Man stayed silent, like he had nothing to say to the claim. After all, everything Bayle had said was true. Beyond that, though, the Bunny Man had already indicated that he was done watching Bayle and that he had gotten what he had wanted from him.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the Bunny Man&rsquo;s silence, Bayle ultimately began to slump over in an irritated silence, like the door leading to his decided fate was just an afterthought rather than the end point of his life. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So they began step by step; thoughtlessly, Bayle walked alongside the Bunny Man, until they had finally reached it. Both of them stopped in place, for a couple of seconds, neither opened the door. By this point, the situation finally began to kick in for Bayle; they had finally gotten to his &lsquo;final destination,&rsquo; so for the first time, he reluctantly stared at the door. Like he had anticipated the reaction without even looking at Bayle, the Bunny Man finally opened the door and bowed while moving his right arm to gesture Bayle inside. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle&rsquo;s reluctance only remained for so long as he walked inside, while briefly looking around at his surroundings; however, upon doing so, his eyes darted towards the giant cross that sat erect in the middle of the room and the plethora of red markings on the floor underneath it. His body innately straightened at the sight, &lsquo;Was it blood?&rsquo; was one question that immediately flashed in Bayles&#39; mind. Behind him; however, he heard the door close, so he quickly began to turn towards the only other person in the room with him. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could completely turn his body, a sharp pressure pushed against his body, and an aching pain began to spread across his chest. He looked down at his chest and saw an earth colored hand sticking through his body. Instinctively, he began to touch it, but before he could, his whole body fell to the ground. Whilst doing so, he felt his bones grind against something hard.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His eyes were too blurry to make out what happened, causing Bayle immense confusion, as he keeled over. Just as he began to feel the gaping hole in his body, the feeling of horrid pain began to sharply increase. Even with his growing adrenaline, as soon as he became aware of the hole in his body, he began to feel pain unlike any other he had ever felt. He could not hold his screams of fear and pain. His breathing started to stagger. The world around him became more and more unstable, until he couldn&rsquo;t see anything other than indiscernible colors. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked around in desperation, his mind racing to find anything to save him from his death. In front of him, he saw a one shape close in towards him while speaking something he couldn&rsquo;t begin to understand. The shape came close enough to engulf the rest of the scenery.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle closed his eyes once, then again. Each time the act of keeping his eyes open became harder and harder. However, just before he was able to go unconscious, the world around him began to take shape once more. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before him stood the Bunny Man with a syringe containing nothing, but still dripping with some type of red liquid. He faced Bayle while behind him was a table covered in a white cloth; underneath something large bulged outwards.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although Bayle began to regain his vigor, his delirium still prevented him from understanding what the Bunny Man was saying. He couldn&rsquo;t move his body whatsoever, but his eyes remained open. He couldn&rsquo;t speak, he couldn&rsquo;t cry anymore. He was like a lifeless body that loosely contained Bayle&rsquo;s consciousness. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle&rsquo;s body began to rise in one quick motion, as he felt a pressure underneath both of his shoulders lifting him up. While he was unable to confirm what it was, what he could see was the cross, which moved closer and closer towards him, until it was right in front of him. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was turned around, and while one side of his body limply fell downwards, the other was raised towards one side of the cross. The only thing in front of him was the Bunny Man, who held one side of his body upwards. Before understanding the sight before him, Bayle felt a short sting of pain in his left hand. Afterwards, his limp side was moved upwards, and the same pain was felt through his right hand. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man then moved away and towards a bench which held an assortment of items, including a box of some sort. Grabbing the box and some other bright stick from the wall nearby, he walked back to the cross and dumped the liquid all over the cross, but not over Bayle, instead over the area underneath him. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle couldn&rsquo;t fathom the scenario in front of him; his brain couldn&rsquo;t think of anything. All he could do was lifelessly watch the Bunny Man bring the bright stick close to the area he had dumped the liquid over. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bunny Man: &ldquo;You seem to still be alive, even if by a thread. I really do hope you&rsquo;ll survive this. Like you said, it&rsquo;d be anticlimactic if you died, but I suppose you can&rsquo;t help it. However, rejoice, as I&rsquo;ll still pray for you. An apostle&#39;s prayer can go a long way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man then took one second to look over at Bayle&rsquo;s lifeless body, before bringing the light close enough to engulf the liquid and the cross underneath Bayle. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The light began to spread until it finally reached Bayle&rsquo;s feet. He still could not scream as he felt the light engulf his body. Slowly, the light spread until the smoke resulting from it blocked all but the Bunny Man from Bayle&rsquo;s sight. His mind struggled helplessly to breathe, like it was trying to keep Bayle alive even now. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Bunny Man stared directly at Bayle&rsquo;s eyes, and Bayle couldn&rsquo;t help but look helplessly around, until finally doing the same. He stared at the Bunny Man while his body burned away under the light&rsquo;s immense heat. The sensation was something he could not have ever imagined. However, underneath such pressures, he stared at the Bunny Man. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He started and stared. At some point, a light began to glow once more in his mind. He began to understand what was happening to him. He began to feel something other than his skin melting off his body. He felt an indescribable sense of anger. He felt no fear; he didn&rsquo;t want to be saved. He stared, with his eyes wide with emotions greater than the pain he felt. He could finally feel his teeth grinding on each other. Then, in a fury, he bellowed with all his might. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle&#39;s mind began to race; he thought about the Bunny Man&rsquo;s words, how he &lsquo;hoped&rsquo; that Bayle&rsquo;d survive, that he&rsquo;d &lsquo;pray&rsquo; for it. The anger Bayle felt increased more and more with every word he remembered. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How dare he? How dare that accursed demon pray for his survival! Bayle roared with anger. How could he die like this? How could he let the Bunny Man win? After everything he&rsquo;s been through, how in the hell could he let the Bunny Man take everything away from him? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;I&rsquo;LL BE BACK YOU DEMON. I&rsquo;LL CLIMB OUT OF THE PITS OF HELL TO DRAG YOU DOWN.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle gargled his insides whilst declaring his hatred for the Bunny Man, who stared just the same. His expression was well hidden underneath his mask; however, his body shifted while his hands twitched. Whether or not it was from anger or something more sinister was incomprehensible. Nonetheless, he looked on with full attention.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;Ihateyou..Ihateyou..damnit&hellip;&hellip;..&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With his final breaths, Bayle continued to express his intense anger. Even on the verge of death, he simply refused to accept it. So as his eyes finally began to give out and his pulse began to freeze, he continued to simply hang there motionless. His body continued to be charred from the flames, while his lungs filled with smoke. Before his breathing finally stopped, he cursed at the Bunny Man, then at the world, then finally himself. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c7 c11">Part Two</span></p><p class="c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 433.00px; height: 577.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 433.00px; height: 577.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Countless dead bodies lay piled up on either side of the hallway. Each body was meticulously arranged on top of the other so neither pile would collapse under the weight of each dismembered corpse. Where an arm and leg remained, another head and torso were nearby, all working together to support the wall of bloody corpses. While some bodies still had certain body parts remaining, others only had a single piece. Despite that, even the bodies that still retained their limbs, were contorted in ways even more unsightly. Some had been there long enough for their ligaments and bones to balloon up or turn liquid-like.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Underneath one of the piles was a lifeless body like the rest. Aside from its head, it missed its complete lower half and only retained one singular arm connected roughly to its torso. In comparison to the others however, this seemed a little less egregious.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It remained motionless underneath a pile of limbs and organs, drowning in a flood of their blood. The world here was silent, nothing but the water dripping from the ceiling. Each drop periodically interrupted the melancholy silence the darkness created. It was an enclosed space of irredeemable peace. However, despite the scenery, this place was not completely void of life. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That lifeless body twitched ever so slightly. Once, then twice, its fingers contracted before its lifeless eyes began to shine with life. Once like a doll, the corpse began to slowly come back to life. Then, at once, it stopped moving. For seconds, it had seemed like the body returned to its motionless state, until suddenly its eyes began to widen and it gasped for air. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In one desperate gasp, its body tried to instinctively pull in air into its critically damaged lungs. Air passed through its lipless mouth, then into its punctured throat, before leaving out of the haphazardly severed torso. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For minutes, the corpse gyrated in an instinctive panic, unable to take in any oxygen or feel its surroundings. The mind of the corpse wasn&rsquo;t any more sophisticated than a toddler&rsquo;s, and just like one, it tried to cry. The corpse tried to yell, it tried to make sense of where it was, but just like all other senses, it couldn&rsquo;t see under the piles of meat on top of it. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, a small glint of light penetrated the darkness that covered the corpse&#39;s body. Upon seeing that, the corpse waved its arm, trying to dig its way out of the waste of blood and limbs. It mustered all of its strength into its arm, which moved slightly forward, pushing at the pile of limbs constricting it. That slight movement triggered a cascade which pushed the torso blocking its arm off, allowing another arm to fall in its place, then another after that. One by one, the bodies that packed the corpse in place began to give and fall out, allowing the corpse to finally escape the darkness it had awoken to. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse fell alongside the pile, on top of a series of arms and legs which cushioned its fall. It fell on the side of its only remaining arm, forcing its body to look towards the light that emanated in the distance. The light shone bright yet indiscernibly. The corpse&rsquo;s eyes, glazed with blood, couldn&rsquo;t adapt to the light. So the corpse simply looked onwards, unable to blink without eyelids, or do much of anything else. The eye stared helplessly forwards; its body unable to move any longer. All of its limited energy was exhausted just pushing out of the pile, so now it returned to motionlessness. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The eye stared and stared. The pain of the light went unnoticed as the corpse continued to look on, even when the world around it began to darken once more. It continued and continued, even when it couldn&rsquo;t see any longer. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, after another lifetime of nothingness, the corpse was once more returned to a state of lifelessness. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In these fading moments, the corpse thought of only one thing. It thought of something tall, something white yet scary, something which evoked a sensation of pain in its mind. Even if for only a moment, it was still there. But even that came to an end, and the mind once more became dark. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">*********************************************************************************************</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an impossible length of &nbsp;time after the corps&rsquo;s second death, its singular eye opened once more. However, this time in a new environment, nothing like anything it&#39;s ever seen in both this life and its previous lives.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ground sparkled under a great purple hue that stretched across the horizon of the endless plane. The eye looked forward in one direction, unable to process its world or feel any sensation. Its mind was still as dark as when it died. Despite that, something not completely benevolent or malevolent was keeping the eye focused on what was ahead. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On top of the clear liquid was a singular, small wooden boat that paddled slowly across the surrounding void. On either side of the eye, there was nothing except for the same clear liquid and the same purple horizon. In the distance, where the water met the sky, darkness was created. It covered what the eye was unable to observe as it was currently. For now, all the eye could do was witness the boat move closer and closer in an oddly obtuse pattern. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boat moved in half circles, moving in a direction slightly off from the eye, then correcting to another direction. Each time ending up in a different direction, causing the boat to round its way back over. The boat moved like it was unsure of where it was supposed to be going, like it too could barely see the eye. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, with each passing second, the boat came closer and closer. For what seemed like tens of minutes, the boat moved around and around, until finally settling somewhere in front of the eye. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, with its side facing the eye, a hand popped out from inside the boat. Grabbing at the side of the boat was a thin skeletal hand. Each joint of the skeleton snapped into place as it slowly raised itself straight. It moved in jarring patterns, each joint snapping into place and each limb moving around wildly to do so. The eye simply watched along without thought or fear. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once the skeleton was finished piecing itself into place, it hunched over lifelessly, like some unseen force had stopped supporting it. Its legs stood completely straight, supporting the rest of the body through some magical means. It stared at the waters without purpose, until its hands finally moved over its sockets. Upon doing so it began to hunched backwards, falling out of the boat and into the water below. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Covered by the width of the boat, the eye couldn&rsquo;t see the skeleton anymore; however, oddly enough, it could now hear. From beyond the boat, the eye could hear bones cracking under each other, as it heard what could be collisions; it sounded like hard rocks smashing into each other, or more likely bones. This continued for a second </span><span class="c10">until stopped</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;abruptly. Once the noise stopped, the same hand grabbed the boat once more, lifting the skeleton and revealing the new cracks that covered its face. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From inside the cracks, the eye could see a small darkness; inside the skull, an incomprehensible darkness flowed outwards, a mist which slowly covered its body. An aura was beginning to form and the skeleton was slowly being given life that went beyond the world in which it was born.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The jaw of the skeleton moved up and down a few times, like it was testing its new body. Then it began to speak; at first it was something unknown to the eye, but as time passed, the voice became more and more comprehensible, until the eye could barely understand the words being said. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;This should be enough, any more and you might catch on. Right now, you will not have the privilege to hear my true words. For now, until you grow stronger, your subconscious will translate for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like an introduction, the skeleton briefly explained away things the eye could not question further, or even understand. Upon finishing its introduction, the eye involuntarily, or rather finally, was able to blink after an eternity of watching. The eye blinked for a brief moment, but within that split-second darkness, the skeleton was able to close the distance between itself and the eye. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The skeleton had moved beyond the boat and was right in front of the eye. The void inside of the skeleton&#39;s skull stared at the eye intently, before straightening upwards and looking down at it.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;You have survived as a result of my benevolence. For the reason that you refused to accept death, I will steal your sacrifice for myself. From now until you&#39;re finally prepared for death, I will empower you to live once more. I will let you live a life greater than what you have experienced uptill now. I will grant your deepest wish and let you live as you see fit. What you do is entirely up to your discretion; however, for each moment you live, I will steal a piece of you and as you live longer and longer, I will steal more and more. It will come to a point where if you do not fight me off, then I will steal the very gift I&rsquo;ve given you. Once that comes to pass, then you will once more be reduced to a pile of meat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With each sentence the voice of the skeleton became more and more out of sink to its jaw. After each sentence the delay increased, until it took seconds to hear each sentence and minutes to hear the entire sentence.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once finished with its demands, the skeleton moved backwards slowly, until it was over an arm&#39;s length away from the eye. Once at the appropriate distance, the mist from within the skeleton expanded outwards, past its hand and down to the water. It reached below the surface of the liquid, until finally disappearing to reveal a gigantic great word. From outside of the water, only the hilt and a portion of the blade was visible. The skeleton slowly raised the greatsword upwards, revealing a larger and larger blade, until it reached even larger than the skeleton itself. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The skeleton paused for a moment before taking a few steps forward; then, with both hands gripping the hilt, it bent backwards, before snapped upwards in one quick motion. For less than a second, the sword remained over its head, allowing the light of the purple horizon to shine brilliantly across the expertly made blade. Following that short pause, the skeleton brought the greatsword straight over the eye, which remained stationary, completely oblivious to its imminent demise. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In less than a second, the eye darkened once more. The sound of the greatsword crashing down into the water quickly faded out, leaving the eye in the much too familiar nothingness, where nothing could be seen, heard, or comprehended.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">*********************************************************************************************</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last, the eye of the corpse opened wide once more. This time; however, the corpse remained unmoving, in the same place where it had fallen. Its eye moved from the top, to the visible bottom of the room. Even so, little could be seen in the darkness and aside from the arm that landed right in front of the corpse, everything else was indiscernible. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a minute, the corpse watched on, half looking at its surroundings and half processing what had happened prior. What was left of its body waited motionless while the corpse took in all the information forced onto its exposed brain. It was like the body couldn&rsquo;t move without it, or that the brain couldn&rsquo;t work to begin with. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After some time passed, the eye of the corpse blinked once more, before settling onto a distant shine, one that pierced the thick darkness that veiled the room. With that, the corpse finally began to move once more. Its limbs twitched as they struggled to move, and while the corpse was getting slowly acclimated to its broken body, it finally sat up with the support of its only arm.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sat upwards as straight as it possibly could underneath a pool of bloody limbs, which slipped slightly forwards. While grabbing onto some piece of flesh or bone to hold its place, the corpse looked straight forward. Its body, devoid of a pulse or breath, sat there silently. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while, the corpse let go of the flesh it was holding onto and looked at its hand, covered in some type of dark liquid. It observed the only limb it had remaining, and looked on curiously. It looked on with a mixture of confusion, with a peaceful attentiveness, like someone birdwatching. The corpse didn&#39;t quite know what to make of it. That is, until its brain had finally finished processing all the information, both new and old.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For longer than a minute, the corpse stayed motionless once more, before blinking one last time and finally waking up. Its eyes widened until it became too painful, while its arm fell to its side once more as the corpse gasped violently for air. Now fully out of its trance, the corpse finally began to register its circumstances, or at least as well as it could with its consciousness desperately trying to undergo the motions required for human survival. The body of the corpse gasped relentlessly, while its brain created pain in places where limbs didn&rsquo;t exist. While unknown to the brain, it still registered the corpse&#39;s limbs as still attached and treated them as functional. However, every time the corpse tried to move, its body couldn&rsquo;t keep up. The only part of the body that could move was its arm and its neck to a small degree. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This desperate struggle continued for what felt like an eternity, until the corpse couldn&rsquo;t physically continue any longer. At this point, the corpse&rsquo;s body didn&rsquo;t have the energy to try and struggle anymore, leaving it with its thoughts. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse began to think basic thoughts about where it was and how it had gotten there, while thoughts of another person began to flow in. First, it started small, with the corpse remembering small things like the feeling of its body, then its name and connections. Starting as a trickle of information, quickly became a flood of emotion and thoughts, ones that defined the very person it had been. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It remembered the village, the people. Then it remembered how it hated them. It remembered how they pushed their ineptitudes onto him, after neglecting his very existence. He remembered how much he hated that village chief, who spent his countless years cowering away behind the people he instructed to fear living. But most importantly, he remembered the moments before his death, the emotion that overcame all common sense. He remembered how much he loathed the Bunny Man, how his body churned at the thought of him. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, beyond all of that, he also remembered what he said; he remembered his initial declaration, how he stated his survival hours before his gruesome death at the hands of the Bunny Man. The corpse felt all of his emotions coming and going as he remembered the next details of his life. Through every moment he could remember well, there was one common truth: his hatred for the people around him. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He continued to sink into the mess of limbs underneath him, while he contemplated all of his regained memories and emotions. After seeing how he lived before his eyes once more, he didn&rsquo;t regret a single thing. For what was the first time since coming back to life, the corpse smiled as much as its face allowed it to. While doing so, blood began to pour from the top of his mouth, as his gums agitated and oozed outwards. Despite feeling this pain, he didn&rsquo;t stop. For him, an experience like this was better than any type of drug. His face expressed that to a much lesser degree than how he felt. It could be an overstated ego over living, or just an intense sense of self-love, but the corpse couldn&rsquo;t help but love every moment of being himself. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sat there for a couple more minutes, taking in and swimming in his jubilation, before finally focusing on his surroundings once more. In a much better mood, his body forgot its need to breathe, allowing him to finally think. However, it could have been an accumulation of his brain leaking from his head or some type of trauma, but he stared straight at the distant shine once more, completely disregarding everything he had and hadn&rsquo;t seen around him. Nothing important was on its mind, as it stared. It didn&rsquo;t mind not having a lower body, another arm, or another eye. It was just curious about the light; it asked itself what it could be. In this dark, damp place, what could be shining so brightly? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather than just staying put and staring like it had been up till now, the corpse pushed upon the mess of limbs behind it, allowing it to fall face first into another pile of limbs underneath it. It used its singular arm to grab at anything it could. With each inch it crawled forwards, more and more blood smeared across its torso and face. By this point, the only thing it could move was just its eyes and arm; its neck was completely stationary, barely even supporting its head, much less moving. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">After a while of grabbing at mush, it finally got a hold of some type of hard bone, allowing it to slowly crawl its way off the pile of limbs and onto the padded floor. The corpse continued to try and grab at the floor, but its padding made it hard to keep a hold of, especially as the corpse lacked nails. That alongside its </span><span class="c10">hand</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;being completely covered in different segments of organs and blood.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, no matter how hard it was, the corpse simply didn&rsquo;t find any dissatisfaction with it. Maybe it was still feeling its high, or it couldn&rsquo;t care about what its body was doing. Regardless it just continued to ponder. What could be making that light? Could it be the same things it had seen in the hallway before its death? Or was it something completely different, like the shine of the golden handle or rocks from the village? The corpse, in its lifetime, had little to no knowledge of much of anything that went beyond the narrow space between the village and the room in which it had died. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While it pondered whether or not it was something it had seen prior or something entirely new, its body slowly continued the mindless actions of extending its hand out, grabbing onto the floor, then sliding forwards. This repetition, although inefficient, still sent him forward, albeit in an extremely short distance. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unable to care whatsoever about its situation allowed it to get bored with itself. Its mind contemplated the same concepts over and over again, until it had put a pause to its curiosity. Even so, it continued. At this point, it had already committed to moving towards the light and that, alongside its small curiosity, gave it reason enough to move. Unable to see anything other than the ground itself, as it dragged its face, the corpse began to reminisce on its life once more. While the ecstasy wasn&rsquo;t as big as the first time, it still gave enough enjoyment to entertain itself for the rest of the journey. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For what was now the overwhelming majority of its new life, the corpse dragged on and on and while doing so, had finally reached a point where the light could illuminate the surroundings a little more. Even still, with the corpse&#39;s face still on the ground, not much had changed. While the corpse couldn&rsquo;t see its surroundings well, it could make some guesses; it could guess at the countless bodies and the structure of the room. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the truth of the world it was born into was much worse than just that. The corpse had begun to guess at why he was where he was instead of where he was to begin with. In this backwards reasoning, he began to slowly recall the skeleton. He began to recall a boat, something reflecting, then a color he hadn&rsquo;t seen anywhere other than on the Bunny Man. That simple detail was enough to put a bad taste in its half-broken, blood-soaked mouth. Its face, already in a natural grimace, didn&#39;t need to move much.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How the corpse came back to life wasn&rsquo;t even a passing thought. To him, the act of living even after his circumstances wasn&rsquo;t anything too abnormal. This was one of many things that were noticeably the same even after actually going about dying.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse felt little of the pain its body was in, in many ways, because of its lack of working nerves, but maybe in part of the magic which resurrected him in the first place. However, while going about the motions, the corpse&#39;s head came into contact with a sharp surface, which gave the corpse a pain similar to when it had died. Some type of sharp object had lodged itself into the corpse&rsquo;s head and into its brain. Upon feeling the sharp object, the corpse instinctively pushed backwards, causing its hand to slip, preventing its head from leaving. The pain grew even harsher as a burning sensation ached through its head and down to the remains of its body. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the initial try, the corpse was unable to move away out of shock, causing its arm to stop being able to move entirely. After what was a handful of excruciatingly slow seconds, the arm of the corpse was tugged on by an unseen force. This force was strong enough to rip the face of the corpse&#39;s head halfway, allowing even more parts of its inside to fall out in a mushy pile of blood and brains. At this point, its body was dangling helplessly from the rock-like hand that had grabbed it. Despite what happened, the pain of having its head split in half was oddly like a needle. Just like a needle, the pain was momentary, but still uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, the singular thing that remained working was once again its one eye, which looked on in a wide expression of pain. Even with its brain mostly gone, it still felt the burning sensation somewhere. The pain it felt still emanated even if the corpse couldn&rsquo;t mark where it necessarily was. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse, through streams of blood, saw what had grabbed its body. Before him was a confusing sight, with the most eye-catching part being the large, beast-like skull, followed by the many spikes that protruded from its poorly retained skeleton. Its rib cage sprawled all around the skull, which sat on top of a podium made from other pieces of bone from all over its decomposed body. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse was unable to articulate its head enough to make out what had grabbed its arm; the only clue was the discomfort it felt, as something sharp pricked the flesh of its arm. Alongside that, the only thing the corpse could see from its peripheral vision was the stream of blood which trickled down its arm.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the corpse being able to see this, it meant the light which it had tried getting to was now nearby. However, this didn&rsquo;t resolve the initial problem: what had caused the light to begin with? There was nothing around that lit up the area; rather, it was like the corpse saw through the darkness. This phenomenon seemed to only exist near the skull. As even now, the corpse couldn&rsquo;t see anything past the skull, or anything to the side of it.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, none of these concerns held a candle to the main problem at hand, the very fact that the corpse was being grabbed at by a skull without any connected arms. The skull itself stood larger than the corpse, but still sat there without being connected to any other bone or ligaments; the only thing recognizable was its cracked jaw, eye sockets, and one warped horn to the right of its head.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The skull&#39;s hypothetical hand continued to grab at the corpse&#39;s arm, slowly putting more and more pressure onto it, like it was feeling out what it had caught. After another second of feeling the corpse&#39;s flesh and bones, a small line formed from a previous crack off the right side of the skull&rsquo;s hollowed nose. This crack, compared to the other in the skull, was relatively straight, like a rushed pencil drawing. Slowly, it began to break open; first, the crack broke into multiple cracks, then those cracks broke open even more and after more struggle, those cracks finally opened up to create a hand-sized hole. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not even a second after the hole was made, something white opened up within the darkness inside the skull. The eye of the corpse struggled as it tried to get used to the new way it saw within the darkness. From the brief moment that the crack had been opened, it looked to be an off white oval which surrounded another darker white circle. Before the eye could completely make out what it had witnessed, it heard a bellowing voice.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;You vile little miscreant. How are you still alive, especially in a state like this? I refuse to believe someone like you has gotten death&rsquo;s blessing and not over the rest of those damned to this hell. You&rsquo;re but a selfish, delusional rodent. Tell me now, what is it that makes you special in any way over the other maggots that pass between my teeth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse somehow heard all of what the skull had said, with each word creating another weight that pressed back at its body, like the words themselves had their own presence. It may have been that he had lacked a body back when interacting with the skeleton, but the words of it could barely compare. Each of the skull&rsquo;s mocking words burned themselves into the corpse&#39;s body.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse didn&#39;t need to process these words; however, from the very first words the skull spoke, the corpse smiled in an odd sense of humor. If the corpse still had a working mouth, then it would have even let out a laugh or even mocked the skull. Too preoccupied with its inner laughter and the fact that it couldn&rsquo;t speak, the corpse hadn&rsquo;t even thought to make a response to the question the skull had posed. Even with the weight of its words, the corpse completely disregarded the severity of the skull&rsquo;s question.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead of replying, the skull had to witness the corpse overcome with humor, which stemmed primarily from the absurdity of the skull&rsquo;s statements. What made it better? Why did it survive? With the serious tone in which the skull spoke? For the corpse, this combination made a ridiculous sight. If not because of its lack of a brain, the corpse simply lacked all survival instincts; even in such a precarious position, the corpse put no thought into its survival. At this, the skull unexpectedly cracked once more across the side of its cheekbone. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only was what the skull said ridiculous, but the fact that a decomposed skull was mocking the corpse was even more ridiculous. The skull was in no better condition and if anything, it was worse; it couldn&rsquo;t move or do much of anything other than hold the corpse in place. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the corpse&#39;s humor fazed out as the skull remained silent, only to then pierce straight through both the skin and bone of the corpse with one squeeze of its hand. Beit from anger or a tiredness at the corpse&#39;s belligerence, the skull was finished just watching the corpse play around with the weight of its statement. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Enough of your mockery, you skinless chicken. Maybe that&#39;s why I cannot see how you&#39;d be favored in any way. You have no mind to use or organs to take care of. Currently, your life is nothing greater than that of a worm&rsquo;s. Nevertheless, you were favored by a god and one who can give you life beyond death. Answer me now! Which god has mistakenly placed their hopes onto you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The skull responded in much the same way as it did previously, except this time asking a question beyond the knowledge of the corpse. The corpse had no way of knowing anything about any gods and barely had any recollection of its one-sided interaction with the one that most likely had given him life. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the corpse had tapered its humor while listening to the skull, afterwards it had completely stopped. Not because of the insults, but because of the mention of gods. The corpse clenched its exposed muscles as hard as it could, while blood spurted out of its mouth. The corpse didn&rsquo;t even try to hide his disdain for the concept of a god taking pity on him. The fact that one had taken pity on him after it was killed as a sacrifice sent its consciousness into anger. Especially as it began to envision the events before its death once more. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once coming to this realization, it seemed almost pathetic that the corpse was ever joyous to survive when it had no direct part in doing so. The corpse completely rejected that idea; it hated everything about it. It hated how the Bunny Man had prayed for its survival and it hated how it may have worked. The corpse couldn&rsquo;t exactly deny it though. The experience it had after first being revived was something easily explained to be caused by something ethereal, like a god. What other concept of being could be blamed for it instead? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all of the insults, the skull had finally successfully gotten a rise out of the corpse, who struggled to come up with anything to refute the claim. However, seeing this, the skull only came to one reasonable conclusion.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;I see. So you don&rsquo;t even have the simplest information about which god has blessed you. You can&rsquo;t even come up with a name? In this case, I suppose it&#39;s good that your mind is so easy to understand; even in this form, I can see your hatred for the Bunny apostle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse was completely blind sighted when called out on its hatred for the Bunny Man, especially as he was the one to stoked the hatred the corpse had for the gods. Even without knowing what an apostle was, the corpse already knew that the Bunny Man had something to do with the god of their village. Its anger was exactly why it remained intently listening, trying to get any information it could on the Bunny Man it hated so much, alongside the god closely connected.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;While I lack major information, what I do know is which god that thing serves. It serves the god of purity and desire, the one you may call Sullivan. Whether or not that is the god that&#39;s favored by you is unclear; however, it&#39;s likely to be the case. If so, then you must in some way exhibit traits alongside that of which it governs. Tell me now: in what way do you exhibit purity?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time around, while knowing which god was most likely to have favored the corpse, the skull still spoke uncertainly, like it had some problems with the idea. Even so, the skull didn&rsquo;t announce why it had been troubled, but instead was pondering on something else intently.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon seeing that the skull had no other details, the corpse began to dwell heavily on what the skull had said. The information was contradictory in some ways, namely in the god&#39;s title: purity and desire. To the corpse&#39;s understanding, purity meant something good, like staying away from impure influences and staying kind to others. However, a god of desire felt more like a bad concept; for the corpse, desire was more often than not something which meant impurity, like wanting what others have or wanting things that one could get through impure means. Beyond all of those problems, the main one was how the corpse sacrifice played a part. Why would a god desire the corpse as a sacrifice, or anyone to begin with, especially enough to favor it. However conceited the corpse was, it understood that its attitudes were nothing to be considered good.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before being able to reach a solid conclusion on the role it played and beginning to ponder how the Bunny Man fit into things, the skull spoke once more. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t quite matter in the end. You, yourself, don&rsquo;t matter much. Whether or not you&#39;re blessed by the god of purity or any other matters little. Even if you were blessed by a god, it&#39;s a stretch to say you were favored. If you were, then I would have already figured out which god it was by now. You are nothing but a maggot spared on a whim by something completely out of your grasp.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time around, those insults not only pushed at the corpse, but also burned deeply into its conscience. Imagining the god that had seemingly pointlessly saved its life from a certain and brutal death gnawed at it. That vision preoccupied it so much that it didn&rsquo;t even notice what the skull had been implying. In the end? What was that supposed to mean for the corpse?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the skull seemed somewhat reluctant in its next actions, its hand detached from the corpse&#39;s arm, like a machine pulling out after cutting fresh meat into strips. After doing so in one motion, it then tossed the corpse away, towards the left wall of the room. The corpse fell straight back-first, into another pile of messy limbs and organs. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse gargled in its blood from the recoil of its body slamming straight against the concentrated wall of meat behind it. Upon recovering from the shock of being tossed away like a toy, the corpse saw the room once more, except now with its eye still adjusted to the darkness. While being unable to see all of the color present in the room, it could still easily make out the walls, which were covered all the way up with skinned limbs and freely disconnected organs. The corpse couldn&rsquo;t properly identify almost any of the organs, but even so, its body instinctively shivered from the sight. Before now, the corpse could guess its surroundings, but now seeing it, the sight was far more horrific. Even in the corpse&#39;s almost sedated trance, it still couldn&rsquo;t help but feel something similar to when it had first died. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This emotion, although still relatively new to the corpse, was all that it could think about. This emotion was raw; it took control of the corpse&#39;s body far more than any other. While it shook the corpse, the very idea of it was something the corpse could see, but it refused to recognize. The emotion that shut down the corpse&#39;s body was fear. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now unable to push it away or shield itself from its influence, fear began to take over the corpse. Everything the corpse saw began to take on a shade of red, increasing in color by the second. Its body, the walls, the floor covered in dried blood stains, then the pools of blood collecting where the floor indented around the skull. Within these few moments, the corpse&#39;s body finally began to develop. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse&#39;s body began to squirm as its many blood vessels expanded from where its limbs should have connected to its torso. Like vines, the corpse&#39;s vessels began to take the form of its many different limbs; however what formed were useless cords of vessels interconnecting into the rough shape of an arm and two legs. The body completely disregarded the corpse&#39;s waist, instead immediately going into remaking the parts the corpse subconsciously deemed best for survival. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, this experience was far too little and too late. While the corpse had begun to recreate its body, the skull began its own revival. In much the same way, many connective tissues began to extend from within the darkness inside the skull. Like an endless void, more and more tissue formed to make a skinless layer of muscle over the skull. Mindlessly, the tissue expanded irregularly, from its jaw, all the way up to half of the skull&rsquo;s singular horn. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once the skull had been fully covered in a layer of tissue, what seems to be the skull&#39;s jaw opened up in an unnatural way, far too open to be possible under the weight of the skull. While it seems that the skull was trying to connect its jaw back on with the use of its newly formed layer of tissue, blood began to flood out of it. Like a river breaking out of a dam, countless gallons of blood vomited out of the skull&#39;s mouth, forming a pool underneath the skull&#39;s podium. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a couple of seconds, the pool of blood just continued to collect underneath the skull, until it had fully covered the skull&#39;s spine. Once fully drenched, the blood began to stick to the broken bones. Filling in each crack, the blood attached itself onto the spine and all other parts of bone within the area of the skull&rsquo;s podium. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse&#39;s fear made it oblivious to the actions of the skull; the corpse had no power to think or move, while its sight was covered with a blinding, hot red. The corpse began to hyperventilate without being able to take in air and just like when it had first woken up, the corpse began to heave. This caused the corpse to begin to fake drown in the blood which pooled inside of its throat. By this point, the corpse was no better than the other corpses that surrounded it. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spine and bones of the skull had by now thickened more than three times their previous width. Each bone had been connected, as each new part contorted around to fit within the whole. The blood covering the bones had hardened into a type of red rock, cracking and filling in with more and more blood. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While it seemed like the process still needed time to finish, the newly formed rock began to move; each inch of movement sent a series of cracks throughout it. From within these cracks, blood oozed out, then hardened once more. With each inch moved, more and more cracks formed and more blooded hardened into new layers of rock. By now, the blood from within the skull largely finished, leaving a small stream of blood still trickling out of its jaw. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a full minute of breaking and fusing, one large pillar of rock had finally stood up straight, which was followed by another pillar. Once these two pillars had stood up, one flat-faced pillar raised another larger block of rock alongside it. Each piece of rock moved accordingly alongside the others to ultimately stack each large formation on top of the other. This slowly created what looked to be a primitive outline of a body. This formation looked to have one leg awkwardly folded onto itself, making it useless to stand with; then it had one singular right arm, which instead of having a hand, had a jagged spike of rock. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The formation stood there unbalanced, with its body leaning heavily to the opposite side of its leg. On the other hand, while the body was stif, something smaller began to move within the darkness. Whatever it was had grabbed onto a piece of the formation&rsquo;s side while moving the rest of its linear body to connect with the upper portion, which had been missing an arm. This revealed the linear body to be an arm, ending with a proper hand; however, instead of one made of rock, the whole arm was still just bone. While the rest of the body had been covered with blood, this was the only part of the skull that remained outside of the blood&#39;s reach. Even so, it seemed that this was the misplaced arm that the skull had been controlling to lift the corpse up.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon the arm finally being attached to the rest of the formation, it finally began to turn towards the skull, which had been patiently waiting. The rock formation used as little movement as possible to position its only good arm in a way where it could grasp at the skull&#39;s singular horn. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once grasping the horn, the formation used its opposing rock arm to support the hand, which wouldn&rsquo;t have had the strength to move the gigantic skull. The hand raised the skull, then turned it sideways for it to fall on top of the formation&rsquo;s straight neck. Immediately as it touched the rock formation, blood began to ooze out of it, then hardened to attach the head to its new body. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse, still choking in its blood, began to panic even more, as the beast began to use its functioning arm to guide its body, which dragged forward. Pain spread throughout the corpse&rsquo;s throat as it tried to force the blood out, resulting in the corpse coughing harshly. Though the corpse had felt fear back when it had died, this was entirely different. Before, it was blindsided. Back then it was still able to function, while now the corpse couldn&rsquo;t focus on anything for more than a second at a time. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the corpse&#39;s body frantically tried to create a way out, its mind was far too desperate to come up with even the simplest ideas. Even now, it was still unable to come to terms with not being able to breathe. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With each inch the beast progressed, the corpses saw more and more of its red, rocky texture, its deadly spiked arm, and the meaty head which sat on top of the creation.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">The beast dragged forwards until it reached a little farther than </span><span class="c10">grabbing distance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the corpse. Unable to bend its body to the side, much less downwards, the beast had no choice other than to grab the corpse while standing straight up. However, instead of continuing until its working arm was in reach, it stopped a distance away; upon doing so, it raised its spiked arm, then brought it down until it pierced the skinless body of the corpse. The beast&rsquo;s spiked arm tore into the shoulder of the corpse, destroying the feeble connective tissue keeping it attached. So as the beast raised the corpse, its arm dangled to the corpse&#39;s side uselessly. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time the beast reached the corpse, the sight of the beast&#39;s full body had sent the corpse into an involuntary shock. The corpse had stopped mid-breath, allowing the blood caught within to splurt out. Ironically, in its desperation, the act of trying to breathe had caused the blood to remain stuck. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though almost painless, the beast&#39;s spiked arm piercing into its shoulder had still sent a jolt throughout its body. As the corpse was slowly raised towards the mouth of the beast, the corpse tried desperately to avoid looking directly at its face. It was like the corpse was still trying to avoid the idea of dying even now. Despite its efforts, this proved pointless once the face of the beast covered everything in sight. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The entire world around the corpse went dark all at once. The corpse, however fearful it was, couldn&rsquo;t prevent its eye from wandering to the gigantic skull in front of it. Now fully up close, the corpse could see patches of skin pulsating, as they grew with every breath the beast took. All the while a warm, dark fog grew from within the void of the beast&#39;s mouth. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse took one glance at the beast&rsquo;s pitch black eye sockets before turning all of its fear towards the mouth. To the corpse, the mouth had begun to grow bigger and bigger, until it was the very world itself. At this point, the face of the beast was almost completely overshadowed, save for a couple of spots where the beast&#39;s skin continued to pulsate. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The beast held the corpse there for a moment longer before finally pulling it closer to its mouth. As the distance closed, the fact that the corpse&rsquo;s entire body fit within the overwhelmingly gigantic mouth of the beast was all the more clear.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The corpse had stopped struggling entirely. The sight was far too overwhelming to try and stop. Even more so now, with the disgustingly useless body the corpse had been given. Within the stillness of the corpse&#39;s mind, it had come to one realization: beyond its gigantic stature, there was nothing natural about the beast. Within the mouth was nothing, no tongue, no bone, only dull teeth covered lightly in the same blood-stained rock the rest of the body was covered in. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not a moment after coming to this realization, in one unnaturally fast movement, the beast had bitten straight through the corpse&#39;s helpless body. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">*********************************************************************************************</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world was a never-ending darkness. There was no sound or feeling; the corpse couldn&rsquo;t even hear its own body. Its heart remained still, as it drifted in the void. There was no ground or ceiling; there was nary a whisper or dripping of water. This time around, the corpse was undoubtedly dead. However, despite that, the corpse still lived on. With what life it still had, it could only acknowledge its circumstance. It knew it had died; however, it couldn&rsquo;t feel despair. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With its singular eye, it looked on and on, only seeing nothing with each glance. This went on until it couldn&rsquo;t tell whether or not it had still even had an eye; after all, it had been consumed whole. The corpse knew it was dead but didn&rsquo;t even try to come to any type of conclusion. It didn&rsquo;t wonder how it had died, whether or not it had been digested, or if it could still try to survive.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After what felt like an eternity in this void, the corpse became numb to anything. In a place devoid of everything, the corpse couldn&rsquo;t help but just drift along. There was no use in thinking. Every thought just cascaded into another, leading to more and more despair. The corpse couldn&rsquo;t help but stop caring. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was its life all that worthwhile? By its definition, did it ever live inside the village? Even so, after leaving, it still couldn&rsquo;t live. It didn&rsquo;t matter whether or not it wanted to, or whether it was determined to live. In the end, both of those things were pointless. The corpse couldn&rsquo;t fend for itself for even a day without dying. Even if it were still alive, what difference would it make?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Truly, this worm was pathetic. Why was it even born? Did it exist just to die over and over and over and over and over again? If not, then why else? To be eaten by a monster? Why the hell did it even try to live after dying the first time? What made this worm more special than the others?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It couldn&rsquo;t even begin to grasp at the shallow dreams entrusted to it by the other worms. No matter how much the worm hated, it still lived a life worth nothing more than the others around it. Even worse, it died after being pitied by the god it regarded as false. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why did it have to go after the light? Why did it move? It could have just waited for something. It could have just lived right there until something. Why did it have to mindlessly move towards the only bit of light available? If only it could have been more sensible. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once more, the thoughts of the worm led it straight back to its agony. It couldn&rsquo;t even drift along in nothingness without messing up. What a truly pathetic existence. What a truly-</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Pathetic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who said that? What did that mean? A shock split through its remaining body. Pathetic? What the hell? Something rose from within the-</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Worm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once more, something entered the mind of the worm. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worm? Something else was with it. Nevertheless, who was it that said that? What gave it the right to call this worm pathetic? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The worm clenched the body it couldn&rsquo;t feel. Without knowing it, the worm had once more begun to exist.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">???: &ldquo;Worm? Pathetic? What is this? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The worm couldn&rsquo;t speak, but its thoughts went beyond its body. These thoughts were what was left of the worm. This anger, this frustration, was the only thing left within it. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;TO HELL WITH THAT NONSENSE!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Bayle declared its existence. It let out all of the rage left from being tormented again and again-no, from even before that. Could Bayle let its existence be snuffed out by some random beast? It wasn&rsquo;t even the Bunny Man. In what world would some </span><span class="c10">random creature kill</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bayle, who had lived time and time again? No, Bayle could not let that happen.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bayle: &ldquo;I WON&#39;T STOP UNTIL I KILL ALL OF YOU, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. I&rsquo;ll kill those damn animals, I&#39;ll kill that damn monster, I&rsquo;ll kill those ugly birds, but most importantly, I&rsquo;ll-I&rsquo;ll-I&rsquo;LL&hellip;..I&rsquo;LL DESTROY THAT DAMN DEVIL.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With every name, Bayle lit up more and more. Within this darkness, a new life was born; from within the ashes of another, a new demon of hatred was born. This demon was made solely off of these lingering emotions. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was this truly still Bayle?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. There is no mistaking it. This is the raw essence of Bayle. This is his world. Life was his to pilfer. He refused to let some Bunny or some rock monster take that away from him. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With every thought, as Bayle brightened, another force began to light up in the distance. A blinding light, even brighter than Bayle had formed in the distance. As time passed it only grew brighter and brighter. It was like the light was calling him over, like it wanted Bayle to run towards it. Even so, how would Bayle do so? Afterall, he still only had a singular arm.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even so, Bayle sought after the light that called out to him. Would he let something like this disappear again? Would he continue to waste away in this void? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No. Without a second of hesitation, Bayle staggered forwards. With all of his might, he moved little by little. Even if it took him a year, even if it took him a decade, he would live once more. He grasped at nothingness, with the body he didn&rsquo;t have. With every motion, he moved further and further. He clawed away at the void between him and life. He broke away from the walls containing him. With every motion, the light grew more and more and while Bayle closed in, the light began to fill in the rest of the void. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Regardless of how long it had taken, the light had eventually covered everything within Bayle&rsquo;s sight. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once Bayle had gotten close enough, he could finally see the rest of his body. Was it the same? Or was it different than before? After everything, Bayle couldn&rsquo;t tell. However, he still held his hand out. He stretched it as far as he could. With nothing supporting him, he stood there against the force of the light pressing him back. He moved one step at a time, each one increasing in pressure. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would he make it? Was it possible to make it to the light? </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes! Without a shadow of a doubt, he would make it. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So he did. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After an eternity in nothingness, Bayle had finally made it back into the light. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And not a second later, he broke free from the beast.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c11 c7">The End</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c14"><span class="c9"></span></p></div></body></html>
